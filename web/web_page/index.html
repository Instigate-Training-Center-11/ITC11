                            Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs 
                            and terriers. The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous, as it 
                            encompasses a range of pedigree breeds, informal types and appearances 
                            that cannot be reliably identified. Formal breeds often considered 
                            to be of the pit bull-type include the American Pit Bull Terrier, 
                            American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull 
                            Terrier. The American Bulldog is also sometimes included.[5] Mixed-breed 
                            dogs which physically resemble these breeds often get labelled as "pit 
                            bulls" by shelters.

                            A husky is a sled dog used in the polar regions. One can differentiate 
                            huskies from other dog types by their fast pulling-style. They represent 
                            an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs[1] (the Alaskan Malamute, 
                            by contrast, pulled heavier loads).[2] Humans use huskies in sled-dog 
                            racing. In recent years,[when?]various companies have marketed tourist 
                            treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions.[3] Huskies 
                            are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired 
                            racing and adventure-trekking dogs.
