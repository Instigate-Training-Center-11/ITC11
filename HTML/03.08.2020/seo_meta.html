        <h2>Most Important HTML
            Tags You Need to Know for SEO</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>title tag</h3>
                <p>Perhaps one of the most important HTML tags for SEO is that of the title. This is the label of your
                    content and how searches see your page in Google and Bing. Every result you see in a search engine
                    is derived from the title tag.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Heading tags(h1-h5) </h3>
                <p>
                    Header tags are often used to break up the content to make it easier to read. In reality, about 55%
                    of visitors will only spend 15 seconds at most skimming your content.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Add Alt Tags in Images</h3>
                <p>
                    An important part of engaging the audience is using images. In fact, you can get about 94% more
                    views if you use graphics in your articles.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fine-Tune Meta Description Tags</h3>
                <p>
                    Another vital HTML tag for SEO is the meta description. Like titles, this information shows in
                    search results of Google. Take a look under the link for any search. The snippet of text under the
                    title is usually pulled from the description tag.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Add Open Graph Tags</h3>
                <p>
                    Open graph tags help in boosting search and display abilities for social media. For instance,
                    Facebook will use open graph to display information if your content is shared.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Building Links</h3>
                <p>Getting high-quality backlinks is only part of SEO. You also need to focus on internal links as well
                    as connecting to external sites.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Twitter Card Tags</h3>
                <p>
                    Open graph isn’t the only way to customize data for social media. Twitter has its own platform
                    called “Cards.” Twitter Cards work similar to OG with the exception that these are specifically for
                    Twitter.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Robots Tag</h3>
                <p>The robots tag is a useful element if you want to prevent certain articles from being indexed. These
                    can stop crawlers from sites like Google from accessing the content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Use Canonical Tags when Appropriate</h3>
                <p>
                    When you create a website, it may be accessible in a variety of ways. For instance, all of these can
                    link to the same site:
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Responsive Site Meta Tags</h3>
                <p>About 48% of people will use a mobile search to find information about a product or business. This
                    means you need to focus attention on responsive and mobile designs.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
