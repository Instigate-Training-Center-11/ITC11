The task is to implement a custom binary search tree class with following functions:

constructor:
destructor:

void insert(Node **head, int value):
    The function that adds a node to a tree.

void removeNodeByPtr(Node *target):
    The function that removes a node from a tree.
    
Node *get_node_by_value(Node *root, T value):
    The function that searches a node in a tree.

void level_order_print(Node *root):
    The function that goes through nodes of a tree horizontally.

void inorder_print(Node *root):
    The function that goes through nodes of a tree vertically. (the method of directly iteration)

Please note, these just are examples of function declarations and you can write your own.
